# Capstone-project Description
This project is about maternal health analysis and the attributes responsible for the high risk of deaths in pregnant women . Analysis using regression and classification models to determine the attributes responsible for the risk level response variable . The dataset used for this project is Maternity health.
# Objective :
The objective of this project is to determine the factors responsible for high risk pregnancy . And to develop machine learning models to detect and predict the high risk pregnancy using machine learning models . Finally the evaluation of the accuracy of the models and compare the models to detect which model gives high accuracy .
# Application of the work :
Reducing the mortality rate of pregnant women is one of the main goals for the WHO . And improving preganant women health and wellbeing is very important for the future . So develpoing machine learning techniques to detect maternal health and predicting the high risk pregnancies help hospitals and health care workers take precautionary steps to reduce the mortality rate especially for low income group countries where maternal mortality is high .
