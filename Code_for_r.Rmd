This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Importing dataset
health <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\srava\\Documents\\Ryerson university\\Capstone project\\Maternal Health Risk Data Set.csv")

head(health);
#Determining class of variables 
str(health);
#Missing values 
is.na(health)
#Mean median minimum maximum 
summary(health);
# Standard deviation
sd(health$ï..Age)
sd(health$SystolicBP)
sd(health$BS)
sd(health$DiastolicBP)
sd(health$BodyTemp)
sd(health$HeartRate)


## Histograms for variables 
hist(health$ï..Age)
hist(health$SystolicBP)
hist(health$DiastolicBP)
hist(health$BS)
hist(health$BodyTemp)
hist(health$HeartRate)


#Boxplots 
boxplot(health$ï..Age,main="Age" )

boxplot(health$SystolicBP,main="SystolicBP")
boxplot(health$DiastolicBP,main="DiastolicBP")
boxplot(health$BS,main="BS")
boxplot(health$BodyTemp,main="BodyTemp")
boxplot(health$HeartRate,main="HeartRate")



# correlation coefficient

health2 <- health;
health2[health2$RiskLevel == "high risk","RiskLevel"] <- 2
health2[health2$RiskLevel == "low risk","RiskLevel"] <- 0
health2[health2$RiskLevel == "mid risk","RiskLevel"] <- 1
head(health2)
str(health2)

M<-cor(health2)
head(round(health2,2))
 
# visualizing correlogram

corrplot(M, method="circle")
health2$RiskLevel<- as.numeric(as.character(health2$RiskLevel))









Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
